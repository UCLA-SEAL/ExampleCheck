# ExampleCheck
Are Code Examples on an Online Q&amp;A Forum Reliable? A Study of API Misuse on Stack Overflow (ICSE 2018) Augmenting Stack Overflow with API Usage Patterns Mined from GitHub (FSE 2018 Demo)


## Summary of ExampleCheck 

Programmers often consult an online Q&amp;A forum such as Stack Overflow to learn new
APIs. This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API
misuse on Stack Overflow. To reduce manual assessment effort, we design ExampleCheck,
an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories
on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Overflow
posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Overflow posts using ExampleCheck and find that 31%
may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such
as program crashes and resource leaks. Such API misuse is caused by three main reasons---missing
control constructs, missing or incorrect order of API calls, and incorrect guard conditions.
Even the posts that are accepted as correct answers or upvoted by other programmers
are not necessarily more reliable than other posts in terms of API misuse. This study
result calls for a new approach to augment Stack Overflow with alternative API usage
details that are not typically shown in curated examples.
