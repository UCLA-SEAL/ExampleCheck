record[7317c7cf66718690b140aa53e072284c82af796c] = Data back and forth succesful

We can get data back and forth, but the USB connection is pretty
fragile. If the app is running and the cable is disconnected, the
connection won't restart if the cable is put back in. We tried
everything.

record[740cd298a0a6b76bcc7ff9fca37faa0e771c86a4] = Refactored the library some

record[77a092e382914f530f31cc257d1026195a8b0088] = Tested new communication library and protocols

Had to change how the Arduino side worked, so that's different as well.

record[868b81ab45c14734a0df797a77d8e03bbc515c22] = Updated the External Device lib.

Changed BluetoothComm's constructor -- must fix all bluetooth projects

record[a47634f198c61388eb11437e6012fdf32be29a8a] = Got Bluetooth almost done

For some reason, the Android app is dropping messages after it receives
the data.

Still very buggy, needs a lot of cleanup.

Had trouble figuring out how to run the tests with the Arduino

record[fa2752644496489b15f94c3e12da5f60b328e485] = Made the bluetooth stuff more reliable

Changed the null terminator code from 0 to 255 so we don't run into null
termination issues with strings. The Arduino Bluetooth library now won't
let anything through unless it has at least two characters, and only
takes two character at a time. Also, I got the BTRS232 project working
with the Bluetooth library, so I can finally do the tests for it.
